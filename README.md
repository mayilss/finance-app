### State Management

This project uses Redux Toolkit for state management, with two slices:

Transactions Slice (src/features/transactions/slice.ts):

Stores transactions as a Record<string, Transaction>.

Actions: addTransaction, removeTransaction.

Theme Slice (src/features/settings/theme/slice.ts):

Manages mode: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'.

Actions: setTheme.

### Persistence

On every state change, the entire Redux state is debounced (300ms) and serialized to localStorage under the key state via:

// src/lib/persist.ts
saveState(store.getState());

At app startup, loadState() reads that key (if present) and uses it as the storeâ€™s preloadedState:

// src/app/store.ts
const preloadedState = loadState();
configureStore({ reducer, preloadedState });

Resetting State

To clear all persisted data and return to a fresh state:

Open your browserâ€™s DevTools.

Go to Application (Chrome) or Storage (Firefox).

Under Local Storage, select the appâ€™s domain.

Right-click the state entry and choose Delete (or click Clear).

Reload the app.
